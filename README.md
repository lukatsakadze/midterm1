# midterm1
1.in this exam i faced tons of challlanges. it made me realize how less of i know and how much i have left to learn in java.i noticed that i lack practice in java and need to work more in practic and also in theory part. but overally i describe this experience educating and fun.
2.i mainly used chatpt and it was really useful.it helped me tghrpough lots of tasks but it took lots of time to make questions correctly so it could understand. after using gpt i still had to correct some parts of code so i needed to understand the code to correct it.in first task ai was really useful.
3.however in last task ai could not help me as it made me face more problems. but overall it still helped me a lot
